# My Admin Panel Project

# TLDR

This is a project for the Web and Mobile course at ESIR. The goal is to create a web application with a microservice architecture. The application is a simple administration panel for a company that manages associations. The application is composed of a front-end, an API, a mail microservice, a database, a message broker and a reverse proxy.
